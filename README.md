# GIt-commitmassages
This repository contains correct ways to write commits in it
 
Having good history will commmit will help you stand out from others
it will also allow you or other delevoleprs working with you on your code to quickly see what changes were made and why, useful if bugs  appear
will be helpful if you come back to a project you were working on after stepping away from it for a while. You likely won't remember your though process
and changes made when initially writing out the code.


good commit message describe what problem your changes solve and how it solves them

commits have subject and body, the subject has 72-characters limit so keep it short and simple
for example 
Subject: This is the change i made to the codebase. (a brief summary of the change you made to the project)
Body: Describe the problem your commit solves and how.

The primary thing is to let other developers and you gain a better understanding of your commits messages because it does the follwing:
- Provides a subject that specifies your code's action (e.g., "Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo")
- COntains a body that provides a concise yet clear description of why the commit needed to be made (e.g "screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information")
- Separates the subject from the body with a new/blank line. this best proctice I highly reccommend following. IT makes commit messages easier for other developers to read
.
